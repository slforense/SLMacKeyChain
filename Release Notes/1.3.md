GPGKeychain 1.3
===============

New
----
* Clipboard detection: When GPG Keychain is open and the user copies any text key to the clipboard, we now show a dialog asking if you want to import the key. This has been a popular request. Hope you like it! [#248]
* Allow symbols in email addresse for key creation. [#365]

Improvements
----
* The info message is now consistent when revoking a key via rev cert import and via contextual menu. [#346]
* Key import dialog has been improved a lot. Readability and clarity ahoi! After a key import, that key will be highlighted. [#358]
* Display info messages as dialog instead of a text window. [#290]
* Removed delete icon from default icons. [#364]
* Changed keyboard shortcut to update a key from the key server from ⇧⌘Y to ⌘U. That should be both easier and more intuitive. [#356]
* For keys with only one UserID the algorithm preferences will no longer show a dropdown selection with only one entry. [#323]
* Keyboard shortcuts in the Subkey and Key tab now work consistent. ⌘C copies fingerprint with spaces and ⇧⌘C copies fingerprint without spaces. [#359, #354]
* Option to 'Mail public key' is not available for expired or revoked keys. You do not want to share those old keys with the world. [#301]
* Show key details when attempting to import a key and that key already exists. [#289]

Fixes
----
* Keylist is updated as expected when deleting or importing keys. [#357]
